# Warrens Game
Pygame based dungeon crawler game. 
Second iteration on the earlier Warrens project.
 - Moving back to pygame only and away from the OpenGL interface (which was more effort than I could muster :))
 - Migrate to Python 3
 - See if I can convert this to a client server setup.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- pygame

# Features
New features:
- Ported to Python 3
- More PEP 8 compliant, not entirely there yet :)

# Credits
The next installment of the Warrens project.
