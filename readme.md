# Warrens II
A Pygame based roguelike dungeon crawler. 
Second iteration of my earlier Warrens project moving back to a pygame only interface and away from the OpenGL interface (which was more effort than I could muster :))
Also, the project was migrated to Python3.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- pygame
- pyinstaller if you want to package the application (optional)
- Sphinx if you want to generate the documentation (optional) 

# Features

### Code
- Ported to Python 3
- More PEP 8 compliant, not entirely there yet :)
- Added unittests

### Game
- Basic audio
- Improved graphics

### Packaging
- Packaged in a single file linux executable using pyinstaller.

### Documentation
Generated with Sphinx based on in code docstrings.
